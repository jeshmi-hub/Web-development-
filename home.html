                    <h2>How Was Coffee Discovered? – Ethiopia And The Dancing Goats</h2>
                    <p>The most popular origin story of the beloved bean starts with Kaldi and his goats (1) in 700 AD. Kaldi, an Ethiopian (formerly Abyssinia) goat herder stumbled on his goats acting quite strange.

                        They were dancing. This definitely wasn’t normal. He discovered that they were eating red berries and concluded that this fruit was the cause of this odd behavior.
                        
                        After stumbling upon this magic fruit, he shared his findings with a monk, who was ecstatic to find something that would help him stay awake all night as he prayed.

                    <h2>Across The Waters – Onto The Middle East</h2>
                    <p>Though the story of Kaldi cannot be proven to be true, one thing is certain: coffee came from Ethiopia.Another thing we know for sure is where it went next. Coffee made its way north, across the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century.
                        The port at which the beans first arrived was called Mocha.Due to coffee’s growing popularity and the shipment of coffee from the port city, Mocha became synonymous with coffee.So any time you hear the term “mocha,” when talking about coffee, you now know where that term originated.Coffee was grown in Yemen and became well known in Egypt, Persia and Turkey.

                    <h2>Into Europe And Asia</h2>
                    <p>The course of history changes when the coffee bean spreads both east and west: East into India and Indonesia and West into Italy and onto the rest of Europe.Arabia was the gatekeeper for coffee.

                        If a country wanted coffee beans, they purchased it from Yemen. The authorities liked it that way and did everything to ensure that nobody could take fertile beans out of their control and plant the trees themselves.
                        
                        Alas, along comes Baba Budan, a Sufi saint from India who was on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1670. Java becomes another household term for coffee.
